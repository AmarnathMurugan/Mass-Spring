# Softbody simulation using Mass-Spring systems

This project implements mass-spring system using two solvers:
 - Newton's Method \[Based on the paper ["Large Steps in Cloth Simulation"](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~baraff/papers/sig98.pdf)\]
 - ADMM Solver  \[Based on the paper ["Fast Simulation of Mass-Spring Systems"](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~ladislav/liu13fast/liu13fast.html)\]
